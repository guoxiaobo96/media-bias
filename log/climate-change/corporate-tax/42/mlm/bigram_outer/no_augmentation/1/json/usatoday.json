{"sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri.

If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome.

It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant.

JOSHUA BRIGHT/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES According to Perkins and Caddell, Rebekah and Nix met with them a few times to discuss how CA could use the Smith Project. Rebekah was clearly impressed by Nix. In one meeting, according to Perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist.

In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer.

{"sentence": "California just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31.

In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work.

Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M.

Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Europe has reached a tipping point as it grapples with the spread of new coronavirus variants, the World Health Organization's top official in the region said on Thursday, calling for tighter public health controls to slow their transmission. The new variants have been identified in 25 of the European region's 53 nations, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O. 's regional director, told a virtual news conference. We were prepared for challenging times in 2021, and it has been just that, he said. The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said. As the year began, over 280 million people in Europe were living under national lockdowns, and several countries are set to add new measures in the hope of reducing new infections and easing the pressure on strained health facilities.", "word": {"30": {"the": "0.569", "news": "0.062", "reports": "0.025", "this": "0.022", "reporting": "0.011", "which": "0.011", "a": "0.008", ".": "0.007", "his": "0.006", "headlines": "0.006"}, "33": {"times": "0.53", "post": "0.197", ".": "0.031", "report": "0.02", "project": "0.019", "story": "0.013", "journal": "0.007", "tribune": "0.006", "news": "0.006", "vaccines": "0.005"}, "214": {"40": "0.079", "30": "0.053", "20": "0.044", "10": "0.032", "26": "0.032", "100": "0.028", "25": "0.026", "16": "0.023", "200": "0.022", "13": "0.02"}, "217": {"in": "0.8", "across": "0.186", "throughout": "0.01", "around": "0.002", "of": "0.0", "over": "0.0", "from": "0.0", "within": "0.0", "on": "0.0", "inside": "0.0"}}}

The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased.

{"sentence": "Tallahassee: Seniors will get their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared Tuesday, even as frustration grows nationally over spotty supplies of the life-saving medicine. Later in the day, President Joe Biden announced that states would get a roughly 16% increase in deliveries over the coming weeks, allowing more Floridians to get a shot in the arm against a disease that has killed more than 25,600 in the state. The rise in shipments translates to 307,000 first doses and 254,000 booster shots for Florida, according to the state health department.

Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty.", "word": {"154": {"low": "0.901", ".": "0.064", "high": "0.014", "higher": "0.002", "the": "0.001", "lower": "0.001", ",": "0.001", ";": "0.001", "minimum": "0.0", "no": "0.0"}, "157": {"bill": "0.356", "package": "0.182", "panel": "0.13", "program": "0.049", "credit": "0.018", "system": "0.015", "act": "0.014", "plan": "0.012", "group": "0.011", "increase": "0.01"}}}
{"sentence": "Albany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December.", "word": {"85": {"of": "0.994", "across": "0.002", "over": "0.001", "but": "0.001", "in": "0.0", "throughout": "0.0", "except": "0.0", "and": "0.0", "along": "0.0", "around": "0.0"}, "88": {".": "0.476", "city": "0.258", ",": "0.235", "state": "0.014", "cities": "0.004", "county": "0.003", "–": "0.001", ";": "0.001", ":": "0.0", "##ns": "0.0"}, "132": {"northern": "0.293", "eastern": "0.286", "western": "0.109", "southern": "0.102", "southeastern": "0.063", "north": "0.031", "northeastern": "0.021", "southwest": "0.012", "northwestern": "0.011", "northwest": "0.01"}, "135": {"long": "0.214", ".": "0.15", "on": "0.132", "city": "0.081", ",": "0.046", "including": "0.028", "for": "0.022", "between": "0.019", "harbor": "0.018", "across": "0.017"}, "155": {"some": "0.139", "several": "0.108", "most": "0.091", "many": "0.089", "all": "0.078", "nearby": "0.025", "more": "0.024", "surrounding": "0.019", "the": "0.018", "certain": "0.017"}, "158": {"city": "0.996", "county": "0.0", "cities": "0.0", "area": "0.0", "state": "0.0", "harbor": "0.0", "island": "0.0", "central": "0.0", "##n": "0.0", "jersey": "0.0"}}}

Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn't respond when asked how he'll handle the legislation.", "word": {"110": {".": "0.519", "in": "0.233", "if": "0.069", "when": "0.048", "of": "0.024", ",": "0.02", "and": "0.019", "because": "0.016", "as": "0.014", "since": "0.006"}, "113": {".": "0.945", ",": "0.026", ":": "0.002", "as": "0.002", "at": "0.002", "—": "0.002", "–": "0.002", "'": "0.002", "and": "0.001", "in": "0.001"}}}

{"sentence": "Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.", "word": {"4": {"dow": "0.148", "underlying": "0.095", "new": "0.067", "bloomberg": "0.046", "common": "0.023", "the": "0.02", "stocks": "0.019", "10": "0.016", "average": "0.016", "current": "0.014"}, "7": {"a": "0.553", ":": "0.109", "is": "0.09", "with": "0.029", "—": "0.027", "has": "0.02", "-": "0.015", "the": "0.009", "as": "0.008", "an": "0.006"}, "15": {"the": "0.98", "a": "0.01", "our": "0.005", "american": "0.001", "global": "0.001", "your": "0.0", "us": "0.0", "this": "0.0", "an": "0.0", "its": "0.0"}, "18": {":": "0.36", ".": "0.285", "the": "0.203", "is": "0.044", "—": "0.024", ",": "0.014", "as": "0.008", "since": "0.005", "because": "0.005", "?": "0.003"}, "108": {"elect": "0.917", ",": "0.036", "general": "0.01", ".": "0.009", "president": "0.006", "sir": "0.003", "candidate": "0.003", "democrat": "0.002", "and": "0.001", "republican": "0.001"}, "111": {"that": "0.988", "which": "0.004", "to": "0.004", "could": "0.001", "would": "0.001", "should": "0.0", "might": "0.0", ",": "0.0", "may": "0.0", "and": "0.0"}, "115": {",": "0.724", "like": "0.157", "and": "0.032", "including": "0.022", "on": "0.012", "for": "0.007", ".": "0.007", "with": "0.006", "of": "0.003", ";": "0.002"}, "118": {"tax": "0.527", "spending": "0.131", "price": "0.085", "rate": "0.075", "budget": "0.022", "stimulus": "0.009", "index": "0.008", "percentage": "0.006", "average": "0.006", "wage": "0.005"}, "117": {"street": "0.991", "-": "0.001", "reserve": "0.0", "and": "0.0", "bond": "0.0", "market": "0.0", "chase": "0.0", "block": "0.0", "pass": "0.0", "##ow": "0.0"}, "120": {"and": "0.815", ",": "0.119", "or": "0.016", "–": "0.006", ".": "0.006", "with": "0.004", "—": "0.004", "plus": "0.003", "for": "0.003", ";": "0.002"}}}
