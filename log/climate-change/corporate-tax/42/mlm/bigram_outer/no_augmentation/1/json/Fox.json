{"sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri.

If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey.

The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways.

Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him.

He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge.

Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider.

They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes.

{"sentence": "Markets continue to climb, shaking off a grim jobs report. By: Ella Koeze · Data delayed at least 15 minutes · Source: FactSet Financial markets continued to rally on Friday, fueled by bets that a Democrat-led government in Washington would robust fiscal stimulus and despite fresh evidence that the United States economy is backsliding as the pandemic surges. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, climbing further into record territory and bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7 percent higher, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose slightly. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed with a gain of 2.4 percent, climbing to a level it last hit in 1990. Though Washington continues to focus on the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol building on Wednesday, the investing world is instead focused on the wave of spending that could come as Democrats assume leadership of the White House and both houses of Congress That enthusiasm also helped investors look past the Labor Department's report on December payrolls, which showed that U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, the first drop since last spring. The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was targeting trillions of dollars in spending.

{"sentence": "At the same time, few on Wall Street seem to think Democrats will prioritize tax increases, which had previously been seen as a potential risk of a Democratic sweep. Now you have the potential for more stimulus, even possibly an infrastructure spend, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at the investment management firm Invesco on Thursday. So, I think the stock market is enthused right now. And that enthusiasm is pretty strong. Gains continued in other financial markets too. Oil prices continued to rally, with West Texas Intermediate rising more than 3 percent to $52.52 a barrel. A surge earlier in the week, which came after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production, means oil prices rose more than 8 percent this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also continued to rise, reaching 1.11 percent on Thursday. The rise in yields most likely reflects expectations that the Treasury will be issuing large amounts of debt to finance renewed government spending.

{"sentence": "California just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31.

{"sentence": "The confusion is hardly limited to California. In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus.

Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said.

While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported.", "word": {"20": {"3": "0.067", "1": "0.052", "2": "0.051", "10": "0.044", "40": "0.032", "6": "0.031", "15": "0.028", "16": "0.026", "4": "0.026", "20": "0.025"}, "23": {"in": "0.873", "across": "0.037", "of": "0.011", "from": "0.009", ".": "0.009", "outside": "0.006", ",": "0.005", "throughout": "0.003", "and": "0.003", "within": "0.003"}, "30": {"the": "0.652", "china": "0.137", ",": "0.063", "chinese": "0.02", "of": "0.013", "and": "0.011", "an": "0.009", "-": "0.007", ":": "0.006", ".": "0.004"}, "33": {"the": "0.527", "china": "0.253", "and": "0.055", "chinese": "0.042", ".": "0.03", "'": "0.024", ",": "0.013", "-": "0.006", "taiwan": "0.003", "of": "0.002"}, "202": {"1": "0.131", "3": "0.121", "2": "0.095", "one": "0.077", "a": "0.048", "10": "0.048", "two": "0.048", "4": "0.039", "6": "0.036", "5": "0.035"}, "205": {"have": "0.78", "had": "0.206", "has": "0.01", "having": "0.004", "haven": "0.0", "ve": "0.0", "were": "0.0", "hadn": "0.0", "are": "0.0", "also": "0.0"}}}

Now that the investigators have arrived, critics say Beijing's desire for control means the inquiry will probably be more political than scientific. Tracing the virus will be a painstaking task. The team that has come to Wuhan will face a city radically transformed from when the virus first emerged, in late 2019. The city, which went into lockdown on Jan. 23 last year and became a symbol of the virus's devastation, has since been held up by Chinese officials as a success story in vanquishing the virus.

Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest.

The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare.

James Estrin/The New York Times Laura Engle, 78, lives alone in an apartment in Midtown Manhattan. She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. Yet she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City's vaccine finder page on Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and phone number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care's corporate office, which told her to wait. She wanted to register at the new Javits Center megasite, which she had heard about on the news, but couldn't figure out how. I'm willing to wait my turn, she said, frustrated, but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn.

Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing.

Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey. We had calculated internally, just internal calculations, that we could get up to 400,000 – like this big (influx) of 400,000 doses, she said.

Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises.
