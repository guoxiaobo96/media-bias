{"sentence": "Sun flips magnetic field (CNN) -- The poles of the sun's powerful magnetic field have reversed, signaling a time of peak solar activity that could spell trouble for planet Earth, astronomers said this week. The sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. Yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. The bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. It takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. This always happens around the time of solar maximum, NASA physicist David Hathaway said in a statement. The magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good indication that Solar Max is really here. During Solar Max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. Solar blasts heading toward Earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. Astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. Earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. The reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years.

{"sentence": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush, in Philadelphia on Tuesday urging Americans to perform community service, has directed his Cabinet to report within 30 days on ways to boost volunteerism, an administration official said. The directive is part of the president's USA Freedom Corps initiative, detailed in his State of the Union address in January, calling on Americans to give at least two years of service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours, to others. Bush renewed that call in Philadelphia, where he participated in a discussion on volunteerism that was preceded by a tour of the People's Emergency Center, a shelter for homeless women and children. This is a good place to come and start a dialogue, the president said. Societies change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time, and government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in people's hearts.

For starters, Mr. Trump simply cannot believe he lost a once-red Southern state — and cannot comprehend that his own unpopularity hastened a political realignment already taking place in the swing state. At the same time, he is very much in touch with the reality that he holds sway over party's right wing, and sees the runoff as a valuable moment of final political leverage as president. Over the past week, he has whipsawed from supporting the Senate candidates, albeit tepidly, to griping about the legality of the runoffs, far more passionately. The president, who will appear with the incumbent Republicans, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, in Dalton, Ga. on Monday, wrote on Twitter late Friday that the runoff was illegal and invalid, but then urged his supporters a day later to get ready to vote on Tuesday.", "word": {"10": {"messages": "0.951", "message": "0.019", "messaging": "0.014", "emails": "0.002", "with": "0.001", "signals": "0.001", ":": "0.001", ".": "0.001", "images": "0.0", "calls": "0.0"}, "13": {"sent": "0.879", "sends": "0.085", "sending": "0.022", "send": "0.002", "made": "0.002", "brought": "0.001", "went": "0.001", "came": "0.0", "returned": "0.0", "delivered": "0.0"}, "24": {"the": "0.972", "our": "0.002", "a": "0.001", "for": "0.001", "npr": "0.001", "covering": "0.001", "which": "0.001", "us": "0.0", "cnn": "0.0", "cbs": "0.0"}, "27": {"times": "0.938", "post": "0.029", "yorker": "0.003", "magazine": "0.001", "sun": "0.001", "tribune": "0.001", "observer": "0.001", "giants": "0.001", "herald": "0.001", ".": "0.001"}, "30": {"is": "0.755", "was": "0.143", ",": "0.01", "also": "0.008", "started": "0.007", "began": "0.003", "after": "0.003", "starts": "0.003", "begins": "0.003", "reported": "0.003"}}}

It was low in early voting, prompted by skepticism among his own die-hards about the validity of the November results. Mr. Trump muscled his way to power by bullying the Republican establishment — and the party's leaders now worry that he might drag them down with him. In Saturday's call, which was made public by Mr. Raffensperger's office, Mr. Trump vaguely threatened to the secretary of state that he would incite wrath — and discourage Republicans from voting — if he did not get his way. You're going to have people just not voting, said Mr. Trump, hinting at a dark outcome for politicians, like Mr. Rasffensperger, who opposed him. They don't want to vote, they hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. Mr. Raffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said of the taped one-hour call that Mr. Trump did most of the talking.

Comments by Jake Sullivan, the incoming national security adviser, indicated how quickly the Biden administration would be immersed in complex arms control issues with Russia and Iran. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s incoming national security adviser said on Sunday that the new administration would move quickly to renew the last remaining major nuclear arms treaty with Russia, even while seeking to make President Vladimir V. Putin pay for what appeared to be the largest-ever hacking of U.S. government networks. In an interview on GPS on CNN, Jake Sullivan, who at 44 will become the youngest national security adviser in more than a half century, also said that as soon as Iran re-entered compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal — which he helped negotiate under President Barack Obama — there would be a follow-on negotiation over its missile capabilities. In that broader negotiation, we can ultimately secure limits on Iran's ballistic missile technology, Mr. Sullivan said, and that is what we intend to try to pursue through diplomacy. He did not mention that missiles were not covered in the previous accord because the Iranians refused to commit to any limitations on their development or testing. To bridge the impasse, the United Nations passed a weakly worded resolution that called on Tehran to show restraint; the Iranians say it is not binding, and they have ignored it.", "word": {"46": {"the": "0.093", ".": "0.092", "why": "0.07", "losing": "0.042", "this": "0.03", "which": "0.029", "-": "0.022", "blame": "0.02", "that": "0.016", "it": "0.013"}, "49": {"deal": "0.433", "times": "0.065", ".": "0.055", "agreement": "0.044", "election": "0.014", "leaks": "0.013", "deals": "0.011", "purchase": "0.009", "campaign": "0.009", "plan": "0.009"}, "145": {"president": "0.997", "secretary": "0.001", "barack": "0.0", "senator": "0.0", "governor": "0.0", "leader": "0.0", "the": "0.0", "obama": "0.0", "democrat": "0.0", "candidate": "0.0"}, "148": {"we": "0.431", "and": "0.112", "which": "0.071", "that": "0.055", "i": "0.051", ",": "0.049", "he": "0.047", "it": "0.046", "iran": "0.038", "who": "0.022"}}}

Hyde (R-Ill.), as the panel met to hear from constitutional experts about the standards for impeaching a president. We paid attention to the polls and the elections. But, Hyde said, I'm frightened for the rule of law. . . . I really believe that notion that no man is above the law. He condemned all of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, justifications -- 'Everybody does it. It was just about sex.' In the wake of the GOP's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of Americans who say they would like Congress simply to drop the subject of Clinton's alleged misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. But committee Republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat House loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the GOP may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically.

Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Republicans haven't read the election results and that it was quite likely the committee would vote out articles of impeachment. In comments outside the hearing, several Republicans said they did not think disciplinary measures short of impeachment, such as censure, would be appropriate, and some of the experts who testified yesterday said they saw constitutional problems with that approach. I don't think censure is a possibility, said Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.). Either we proceed or we do not. Hutchinson expressed similar reservations. The options are limited constitutionally, he said. Opening the daylong constitutional law seminar, Rep. Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.) was biting in his assessment of Clinton's conduct and the arguments by the president's supporters that, however reprehensible, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.
