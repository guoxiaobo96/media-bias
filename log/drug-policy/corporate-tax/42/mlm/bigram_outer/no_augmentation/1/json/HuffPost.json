{"sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri.

If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey.

The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways.

He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail.

{"sentence": "(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street.", "word": {"57": {"in": "0.51", ",": "0.325", ".": "0.059", "on": "0.019", "new": "0.007", "off": "0.005", "south": "0.004", "-": "0.004", "the": "0.004", "near": "0.003"}, "60": {"city": "0.897", ".": "0.017", "##ny": "0.01", "harbor": "0.004", "long": "0.003", "the": "0.002", "mercer": "0.002", "ellis": "0.002", "##y": "0.002", "governors": "0.002"}, "251": {"new": "0.032", "real": "0.017", "big": "0.016", "way": "0.014", "old": "0.013", "people": "0.013", "city": "0.011", "mayor": "0.011", "political": "0.01", "popular": "0.009"}}}

No Republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the Hanleys believed Ted Cruz could take Caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the White House. They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes.

It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation.

(Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist.

She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump.

Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31.

Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said.

Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments.

The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter.", "word": {"134": {"earlier": "0.305", ".": "0.236", "uk": "0.033", ",": "0.031", "in": "0.028", "late": "0.027", "just": "0.018", "india": "0.015", "later": "0.015", "japan": "0.013"}, "137": {"the": "0.469", "this": "0.335", "a": "0.03", "one": "0.019", "which": "0.014", "that": "0.01", ".": "0.01", "another": "0.009", ",": "0.008", "these": "0.006"}}}

Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Anxious about taking a new vaccine and scarred by a history of being mistreated, many frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes are balking at being inoculated against the coronavirus. But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families.

The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased.

{"sentence": "Santa Fe: An economic relief package is taking shape at the Legislature as a Senate panel endorsed a $600 rebate to low-income workers and a separate bill that would waive licensing fees on liquor stores. Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates.

Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing.

{"sentence": "Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.", "word": {"4": {"new": "0.089", "dow": "0.049", "bloomberg": "0.031", "top": "0.027", "common": "0.023", "average": "0.022", "latest": "0.02", "fore": "0.02", "green": "0.016", "current": "0.011"}, "7": {"a": "0.459", "the": "0.08", "is": "0.051", "as": "0.049", ".": "0.025", "-": "0.02", "—": "0.014", "news": "0.013", "and": "0.013", "index": "0.011"}, "15": {"the": "0.938", "our": "0.014", "a": "0.013", "this": "0.007", "its": "0.005", "american": "0.004", "us": "0.003", "global": "0.002", "your": "0.002", "his": "0.001"}, "18": {".": "0.375", "the": "0.102", "—": "0.077", "as": "0.072", ",": "0.042", ":": "0.037", "is": "0.029", "after": "0.024", "since": "0.02", "because": "0.02"}, "108": {"president": "0.287", ",": "0.24", "donald": "0.112", "—": "0.039", "elect": "0.036", ".": "0.033", "sir": "0.032", "republican": "0.029", "of": "0.022", "general": "0.019"}, "111": {"that": "0.873", "to": "0.101", "which": "0.013", "could": "0.003", "would": "0.002", "will": "0.001", "and": "0.001", "who": "0.0", ",": "0.0", "may": "0.0"}, "115": {",": "0.554", "like": "0.131", "on": "0.127", "for": "0.041", "over": "0.034", ".": "0.015", "including": "0.014", "of": "0.012", "and": "0.012", "about": "0.007"}, "118": {"tax": "0.568", "price": "0.09", "rate": "0.075", "wage": "0.042", "share": "0.022", "value": "0.013", "capital": "0.01", "index": "0.008", "bond": "0.006", "annual": "0.005"}, "117": {"street": "0.999", "st": "0.0", "reserve": "0.0", "road": "0.0", "security": "0.0", "branch": "0.0", "##ie": "0.0", "block": "0.0", "-": "0.0", "money": "0.0"}, "120": {"and": "0.881", "or": "0.059", ",": "0.035", "with": "0.004", ".": "0.003", "—": "0.002", "including": "0.002", "―": "0.001", "plus": "0.001", "to": "0.001"}}}
