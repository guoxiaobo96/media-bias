{"sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri.

If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome.

The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways.

And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets.", "word": {"34": {"two": "0.455", "three": "0.1", "several": "0.093", "##s": "0.087", "many": "0.039", "four": "0.019", "five": "0.017", "some": "0.016", "2": "0.011", "20": "0.008"}, "37": {"a": "0.712", "the": "0.192", "some": "0.039", "an": "0.013", "one": "0.01", "this": "0.009", "another": "0.007", "our": "0.004", "that": "0.002", "their": "0.002"}, "234": {"wynn": "0.39", "corona": "0.042", "fox": "0.027", "trump": "0.021", "casino": "0.018", "suburban": "0.016", "hotel": "0.015", "radio": "0.012", "boeing": "0.012", "air": "0.011"}}}

(Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge.

Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider.

They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes.

Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist.

{"sentence": "At the same time, few on Wall Street seem to think Democrats will prioritize tax increases, which had previously been seen as a potential risk of a Democratic sweep. Now you have the potential for more stimulus, even possibly an infrastructure spend, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at the investment management firm Invesco on Thursday. So, I think the stock market is enthused right now. And that enthusiasm is pretty strong. Gains continued in other financial markets too. Oil prices continued to rally, with West Texas Intermediate rising more than 3 percent to $52.52 a barrel. A surge earlier in the week, which came after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production, means oil prices rose more than 8 percent this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also continued to rise, reaching 1.11 percent on Thursday. The rise in yields most likely reflects expectations that the Treasury will be issuing large amounts of debt to finance renewed government spending.

Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31.

Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing.", "word": {"29": {"the": "0.262", "washington": "0.067", "president": "0.035", "news": "0.025", "sunday": "0.017", "former": "0.016", "trump": "0.012", "2020": "0.009", "2012": "0.009", "2018": "0.009"}, "32": {"times": "0.29", "city": "0.146", "governor": "0.102", "state": "0.07", "post": "0.063", "mayor": "0.035", "senate": "0.016", "islanders": "0.016", "republican": "0.014", "incumbent": "0.013"}, "71": {"our": "0.562", "the": "0.347", "american": "0.034", "us": "0.013", "ongoing": "0.009", "current": "0.006", "future": "0.003", "a": "0.003", "their": "0.002", "national": "0.002"}, "74": {"in": "0.304", ".": "0.257", "policy": "0.132", "emergency": "0.034", "spending": "0.032", "to": "0.016", "funding": "0.013", "and": "0.012", "'": "0.01", "budget": "0.008"}}}

Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M.

James Estrin/The New York Times People who received two shots of the Moderna Covid vaccine in its earliest, Phase 1 clinical trial are being offered a third shot, a so-called booster, as part of a continuing study to determine whether repeated vaccinations are needed, and whether they are safe and effective, the company said on Thursday. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement.

Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults.

The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open.

But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse.

Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing.

Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey.
