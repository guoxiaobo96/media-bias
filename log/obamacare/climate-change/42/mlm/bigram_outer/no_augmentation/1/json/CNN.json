{"sentence": "Sun flips magnetic field (CNN) -- The poles of the sun's powerful magnetic field have reversed, signaling a time of peak solar activity that could spell trouble for planet Earth, astronomers said this week. The sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. Yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. The bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. It takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. This always happens around the time of solar maximum, NASA physicist David Hathaway said in a statement. The magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good indication that Solar Max is really here. During Solar Max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. Solar blasts heading toward Earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. Astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. Earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. The reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years.

{"sentence": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush, in Philadelphia on Tuesday urging Americans to perform community service, has directed his Cabinet to report within 30 days on ways to boost volunteerism, an administration official said. The directive is part of the president's USA Freedom Corps initiative, detailed in his State of the Union address in January, calling on Americans to give at least two years of service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours, to others. Bush renewed that call in Philadelphia, where he participated in a discussion on volunteerism that was preceded by a tour of the People's Emergency Center, a shelter for homeless women and children. This is a good place to come and start a dialogue, the president said. Societies change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time, and government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in people's hearts. Bush said volunteerism has increased since his State of the Union address, and said he had instructed government agencies to make it easier for Americans to volunteer. A senior administration official said the president wants federal agencies to review service opportunities and barriers.

Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein, she let him have her number. Weinstein began calling her late at night, or having his assistant call her, asking to meet. She declined, but said that she would do readings during the day for a casting executive. Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. I was, like, Oh, a woman. Great. I feel safe, Evans said. When Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Weinstein told her that she'd be great in Project Runway, — the show, which Weinstein helped produce — but only if she lost weight.

The president is fixated on his loss in Georgia, an obsession that can be explained by two powerful and concurrent motivations — one psychological, one impelled by calculation and grounded in political reality, people close to him said. For starters, Mr. Trump simply cannot believe he lost a once-red Southern state — and cannot comprehend that his own unpopularity hastened a political realignment already taking place in the swing state. At the same time, he is very much in touch with the reality that he holds sway over party's right wing, and sees the runoff as a valuable moment of final political leverage as president. Over the past week, he has whipsawed from supporting the Senate candidates, albeit tepidly, to griping about the legality of the runoffs, far more passionately.

Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the House speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest majority in almost two decades as Washington prepares for a new Democratic president. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened under the threat of a deadly pandemic and awaited a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of that chamber. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their votes from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. Her victory means that after two years as President Trump's most outspoken antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, she said in a speech after winning the speakership.

In that broader negotiation, we can ultimately secure limits on Iran's ballistic missile technology, Mr. Sullivan said, and that is what we intend to try to pursue through diplomacy. He did not mention that missiles were not covered in the previous accord because the Iranians refused to commit to any limitations on their development or testing.

Hyde (R-Ill.), as the panel met to hear from constitutional experts about the standards for impeaching a president. We paid attention to the polls and the elections. But, Hyde said, I'm frightened for the rule of law. . . . I really believe that notion that no man is above the law. He condemned all of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, justifications -- 'Everybody does it. It was just about sex.' In the wake of the GOP's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of Americans who say they would like Congress simply to drop the subject of Clinton's alleged misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. But committee Republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat House loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the GOP may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically.

{"sentence": "I do not see any change in mood, said Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.). They are two of the key Republican members of an informal breakfast club on Judiciary, a bipartisan group that has discussed the possibility of a solution short of impeachment. Democrats who had hoped yesterday's session might mark the start of a new, more conciliatory attitude by the GOP were disappointed. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Republicans haven't read the election results and that it was quite likely the committee would vote out articles of impeachment. In comments outside the hearing, several Republicans said they did not think disciplinary measures short of impeachment, such as censure, would be appropriate, and some of the experts who testified yesterday said they saw constitutional problems with that approach. I don't think censure is a possibility, said Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.). Either we proceed or we do not. Hutchinson expressed similar reservations. The options are limited constitutionally, he said. Opening the daylong constitutional law seminar, Rep. Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.) was biting in his assessment of Clinton's conduct and the arguments by the president's supporters that, however reprehensible, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.
