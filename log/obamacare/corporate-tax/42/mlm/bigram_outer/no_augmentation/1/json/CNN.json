{"sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri.

If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey.

What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers.

Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside.", "word": {"19": {"the": "1.0", "his": "0.0", "a": "0.0", "that": "0.0", "this": "0.0", "our": "0.0", "its": "0.0", "to": "0.0", "their": "0.0", "trump": "0.0"}, "22": {"there": "0.973", "here": "0.02", "to": "0.002", "then": "0.001", "it": "0.001", "at": "0.0", "they": "0.0", "where": "0.0", "that": "0.0", "first": "0.0"}, "53": {"the": "1.0", "a": "0.0", "his": "0.0", "this": "0.0", "to": "0.0", "our": "0.0", "that": "0.0", "trump": "0.0", "for": "0.0", "federal": "0.0"}, "56": {"there": "0.939", "here": "0.01", "it": "0.004", "at": "0.002", "in": "0.002", "this": "0.002", "to": "0.002", "started": "0.001", "first": "0.001", "the": "0.001"}, "62": {"of": "0.678", "after": "0.111", "to": "0.071", "before": "0.051", "from": "0.044", "the": "0.005", "post": "0.002", "for": "0.002", "as": "0.001", "o": "0.001"}, "65": {"and": "0.35", ".": "0.179", ",": "0.121", ":": "0.019", "or": "0.018", "/": "0.017", "&": "0.01", "said": "0.01", "as": "0.01", "when": "0.006"}, "100": {"17": "0.046", "7": "0.038", "5": "0.029", "10": "0.025", "12": "0.024", "8": "0.023", "11": "0.022", "13": "0.021", "6": "0.021", "9": "0.02"}, "103": {"daughter": "0.733", "sister": "0.096", "wife": "0.069", "mother": "0.031", "son": "0.017", "widow": "0.013", "granddaughter": "0.008", "girlfriend": "0.005", "niece": "0.002", "grandmother": "0.001"}}}

Now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the United States government in Trump's image. Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state. And when Bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known.

Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare.

They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider.

In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. Given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to Cruz.", "word": {"61": {"with": "0.998", "about": "0.001", "by": "0.001", "on": "0.0", "against": "0.0", "to": "0.0", "for": "0.0", "criticizing": "0.0", "as": "0.0", "of": "0.0"}, "64": {"paul": "0.982", "john": "0.004", "mark": "0.002", "tim": "0.002", "speaker": "0.001", "kevin": "0.001", "chris": "0.001", "tom": "0.001", "james": "0.0", "matt": "0.0"}, "67": {"the": "1.0", "a": "0.0", "his": "0.0", "new": "0.0", "their": "0.0", "our": "0.0", "her": "0.0", "former": "0.0", "that": "0.0", "this": "0.0"}, "70": {"journal": "1.0", "review": "0.0", "monitor": "0.0", "advocate": "0.0", "register": "0.0", "##ul": "0.0", "times": "0.0", "journals": "0.0", "post": "0.0", "institute": "0.0"}, "104": {"at": "0.664", ".": "0.175", "during": "0.044", "around": "0.034", "by": "0.013", "and": "0.009", ",": "0.006", "but": "0.006", "all": "0.004", "of": "0.003"}, "107": {"cruz": "0.84", "trump": "0.091", "he": "0.034", "sessions": "0.005", "ryan": "0.004", "paul": "0.002", "mccain": "0.001", ",": "0.001", "walker": "0.001", "john": "0.001"}}}

They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. The accounts may then be closed or become inactive — but may remain linked to the taxpayer's I.R.S. records. Tax prep companies have said they're working with the I.R.S. to resolve the issue.

Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers.

In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work.

Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation.

Kristian Thacker for The New York Times Several states in the American South have been the slowest in the country to roll out Covid-19 vaccines. Georgia has faced a raft of logistical and bureaucratic snags. In South Carolina, the governor gave reluctant health care workers until Friday to get their shots or risk losing their priority status. And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier.

Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest.

There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults.

The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare.

Alex Welsh for The New York Times Deaths from all causes rose sharply during the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic took hold in the United States, reaching levels last seen 75 years ago, according to provisional figures released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics. Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop.

The Senate's proposed additions would come this year, focusing largely on education, business, health, housing aid, transportation and unemployment assistance. It would bring the total amount of the proposal to almost $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year. This is the immediate relief that Marylanders need, said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. Hogan's plan includes direct stimulus payments to low-to-moderate income residents, with benefits of up to $750 for families and $450 for individuals. It repeals all state and local income taxes on unemployment benefits. The governor's plan also includes sales tax credits of up to $3,000 a month for four months for small businesses.

Farley said the organization assured the city that personal information had not been sold, but health department officials were working with the city's lawyers to determine next steps.", "word": {"22": {"the": "0.793", "a": "0.066", "some": "0.062", "several": "0.011", "many": "0.007", "two": "0.005", "multiple": "0.004", "other": "0.003", "that": "0.002", "recent": "0.002"}, "25": {",": "0.783", "–": "0.053", "—": "0.037", ".": "0.021", "itself": "0.009", "policy": "0.008", "decision": "0.005", "regulations": "0.005", "rules": "0.005", "rule": "0.004"}}}

The state will start to receive about 12,800 weekly doses next week, Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, up from the previous weeks' 11,000 doses. The increase comes after the federal government changed distribution strategies and increased shipments to states, rather than keeping vials in reserve for second doses. Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it.

However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises.
