Regarding the unique drink menu, Andrew comments that, Eric Hammer moved specifically into the Director of Beverage role a year and a half ago because we wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the current trendy drinks, and the creativity that comes with that."}

And I never thought that would be the problem with having a baby. The amount of pressure and the amount of responsibility that's placed on our shoulder the moment we give birth and they give us this baby and they're like here you go, good luck. The anxiety. I was overwhelmed with anxiety constantly. And even when Wolfie was asleep, I couldn't sleep, because it was like having a tiny bomb that could go off at any moment. I mean, I can't look back at the aftermath of pregnancy and birth with anything other than, I feel traumatized by that really, still. Yeah. I plan to have another one as well. And all these changes doesn't have any effect on it, because apart from everything, each second I share with her is just amazing, just like heaven. Right. I mean, I oscillate wildly between thinking, I really want to have another baby and to I don't want to have any children."}

Over the weekend, President Trump called Georgia's Republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results.

The president's demand raised questions about whether he violated election fraud statutes, lawyers said, though a charge is unlikely.

In an interview on GPS on CNN, Jake Sullivan, who at 44 will become the youngest national security adviser in more than a half century, also said that as soon as Iran re-entered compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal — which he helped negotiate under President Barack Obama — there would be a follow-on negotiation over its missile capabilities. In that broader negotiation, we can ultimately secure limits on Iran's ballistic missile technology, Mr. Sullivan said, and that is what we intend to try to pursue through diplomacy. He did not mention that missiles were not covered in the previous accord because the Iranians refused to commit to any limitations on their development or testing.

So now we have Stranger Things. And we have The Witcher. And we're growing our own, hopefully, I.P., and franchises, and original content. And so we're going to continue to do that around the world. Money Heist, La Casa de Papel definitely franchise for the company and growing what that is. So I think for us, it's to continue to do that. And again, creators have great experience. And then you hope you get their repeat business. They come back to work with you again. And I think for all of us, it really — you have to win, just like you're saying about what you watch, the consumer every day. Next year, I hope we still have more shows that you like than somebody else has. And I do think ultimately competition is good for consumers because I do think it keeps all of us trying to make the best shows, pushing forward, taking risks on content still.

Hyde (R-Ill.), as the panel met to hear from constitutional experts about the standards for impeaching a president. We paid attention to the polls and the elections. But, Hyde said, I'm frightened for the rule of law. . . . I really believe that notion that no man is above the law. He condemned all of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, justifications -- 'Everybody does it. It was just about sex.' In the wake of the GOP's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of Americans who say they would like Congress simply to drop the subject of Clinton's alleged misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. But committee Republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat House loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the GOP may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically. I think the election probably affected the disposition in the Senate more than it did anything here, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said outside the hearing room."}

Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, and judges across the country have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results.

President Trump about to board Air Force One on Monday to travel to Georgia for a campaign rally in support of Georgia's Republican senators in tomorrow's run-off election that will decide which party controls the Senate. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A group of prominent American historians added their voice on Monday to the debate about President Trump's effort to overturn the election, decrying what they called an undemocratic bid to unravel a free and fair vote that has no historical precedent in the long annals of the United States. Never before in our history has a president who lost re-election tried to stay in office by subverting the democratic process set down by the Constitution, the historians said in a statement. That is what President Trump has been doing since November 3, when a strong electoral majority of Americans chose Joseph R. Biden to be the 46th president of the United States. The historians' statement pointed out that the 2020 election was not even particularly close in historical terms. Mr. Biden won as many or more Electoral College votes as the winning candidates in five elections since 1960 and larger popular majorities than in more than half of the presidential elections held in the last six decades."}

Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys, was arrested by Metropolitan Police on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter banner torn from a historic Black church in Washington during protests last month that led to several violent clashes, including stabbings, around the city. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed that Mr. Tarrio, 36, had been arrested on charges of destruction of property, stemming from a mid-December incident in downtown Washington. Upon his arrest he was found to be in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines and charged accordingly with possession. The arrest also pits the Justice Department against some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters; the U.S. attorney's office in Washington acts as the main prosecutor's office for the District of Columbia. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Tarrio could not immediately be located, and Mr. Tarrio could not be reached."}

The directive is part of the president's USA Freedom Corps initiative, detailed in his State of the Union address in January, calling on Americans to give at least two years of service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours, to others. Bush renewed that call in Philadelphia, where he participated in a discussion on volunteerism that was preceded by a tour of the People's Emergency Center, a shelter for homeless women and children. This is a good place to come and start a dialogue, the president said. Societies change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time, and government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in people's hearts. Bush said volunteerism has increased since his State of the Union address, and said he had instructed government agencies to make it easier for Americans to volunteer. A senior administration official said the president wants federal agencies to review service opportunities and barriers. Lindsey Kozberg, communications director for the USA Freedom Corps, said the goal is to get the federal house in order so that we know where service opportunities exist, we make sure the public knows about those opportunities and we ... break down any barriers or hindrances to volunteer service that exist in our regulations or programs."}

Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia campaigns at Augusta Regional Airport in Augusta, Ga., on Monday. Credit... Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle, via Associated Press A day before facing voters in a runoff Senate election, Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia announced plans to vote against the Electoral College certification process, joining a dozen Republican senators in voting to overturn electors for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. The potentially career-defining vote has divided congressional Republicans ahead of a typically perfunctory session on Jan. 6 to confirm Mr. Biden as president and winner of the Electoral College. Ms. Loeffler, who has aligned herself with President Trump as she fights to maintain her seat in the Senate, made the announcement mere hours before the president was set to take the stage in Georgia to campaign on her behalf. She did not say which state's electors she would object to. It is the latest instance in which Ms. Loeffler has broken with Georgia Republicans, who have largely resisted Mr. Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud after Mr. Biden won the state in November. Tens of millions of Americans have real concerns about the way in which the November presidential election was conducted — and I share their concerns, Ms. Loeffler said in a statement issued Monday evening. David Perdue, whose term as senator ended on Jan. 3, is also facing a runoff on Tuesday."}

Blue for The New York Times BRUSSELS — President Trump's extraordinary, wheedling telephone call to state officials in Georgia seeking to overturn the election results there has shaken many Europeans — not so much for what it reveals about Mr. Trump himself, but for what it may portend for the health of American democracy. Foreign leaders are looking forward, but many worry that the Trump effect will last for years, damaging trust in American predictability and reliability. A lot of people will just roll their eyes and wait for the clock to run down, said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americas program at Chatham House, the British research institution. But by far the most troubling thing is the number of Republicans who are willing to go along with him, and what it's doing to the Republican Party, playing out in real time. A group of House Republicans has vowed to challenge Biden's Electoral College win on Wednesday when Congress meets to certify it, and at least a dozen Republican senators are expected to join them, forcing a vote though it is all but certain to fail. The dangers that entails for foreign allies are manifold and will not be easily dispelled even with a new president. But they are raising special concerns before Mr. Trump exits."}

The recording of the conversation between Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, first reported by The Washington Post, led a number of election and criminal defense lawyers to conclude that by pressuring Mr. Raffensperger to find the votes he would need to reverse the election outcome in the state, Mr. Trump either broke the law or came close to it. It seems to me like what he did clearly violates Georgia statutes, said Leigh Ann Webster, an Atlanta criminal defense lawyer, citing a state law that makes it illegal for anyone who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or otherwise attempts to cause the other person to engage in election fraud. At the federal level, anyone who knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a state of a fair and impartially conducted election process is breaking the law."}

The sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. Yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. The bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. It takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. This always happens around the time of solar maximum, NASA physicist David Hathaway said in a statement. The magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good indication that Solar Max is really here. During Solar Max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. Solar blasts heading toward Earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. Astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. Earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. The reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years. The last one happened 740,000 years ago, scientists estimate. Some suggest the planet is overdue for another one."}

So I just don't know – you know, Mark, I don't know what's the purpose – I won't give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things, but we don't need Dominion or anything else.

If you care about, you know, the values and direction of the nation you want to see, it is your obligation to turn out and vote tomorrow — be you a Democrat or Republican. However right now, given the nature of the president's statements and several other people who have been aligned with him previously, have literally had a rally saying protest and don't vote, we are specifically asking you and telling you, please turn out and vote tomorrow. The president's legal team had the entire tape. They watched the entire tape, and from our point of view, intentionally misled the State Senate, voters and the people in the United States about this. It was intentional. It was obvious, and anybody watching this knows that — anyone watching it knows that. That's why we released the entire tape for people to watch.

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in October detected potentially infectious, or active, virus on a package of frozen cod that had been handled by two port workers in Qingdao who tested positive five days later. The finding suggested they may have gotten infected from the package, although that wasn't confirmed. Experiments with salmon indicate the virus can survive up to eight days in the cold-chain conditions used to export fish, scientists in China said in a report ahead of publication and peer review. Those results, which match laboratory experiments conducted in Singapore, support the Chinese government's rationale for testing imported meat, packaging and containers and blocking goods deemed potentially infectious. No live virus had been isolated out of almost 3 million samples tested until the Qingdao case. Only 22 came back positive as of mid-September, but none was suspected of posing an infection risk. The WHO has said transmission by such means is highly unlikely, but recommends people who handle food practice good hygiene, including frequently cleaning and disinfecting work surfaces, to minimize the risk of contamination."}

Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Republicans haven't read the election results and that it was quite likely the committee would vote out articles of impeachment. In comments outside the hearing, several Republicans said they did not think disciplinary measures short of impeachment, such as censure, would be appropriate, and some of the experts who testified yesterday said they saw constitutional problems with that approach. I don't think censure is a possibility, said Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.). Either we proceed or we do not. Hutchinson expressed similar reservations. The options are limited constitutionally, he said. Opening the daylong constitutional law seminar, Rep. Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.) was biting in his assessment of Clinton's conduct and the arguments by the president's supporters that, however reprehensible, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.

On Monday, Mr. Trump signaled on Twitter that he planned to make his case at the campaign event, intended to kick-start sluggish Republican turnout. It was low in early voting, prompted by skepticism among his own die-hards about the validity of the November results. Mr. Trump muscled his way to power by bullying the Republican establishment — and the party's leaders now worry that he might drag them down with him. In Saturday's call, which was made public by Mr. Raffensperger's office, Mr. Trump vaguely threatened to the secretary of state that he would incite wrath — and discourage Republicans from voting — if he did not get his way. You're going to have people just not voting, said Mr. Trump, hinting at a dark outcome for politicians, like Mr. Rasffensperger, who opposed him. They don't want to vote, they hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. Mr. Raffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said of the taped one-hour call that Mr. Trump did most of the talking. We did most of the listening, but I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong, he added. It was inappropriate, Georgia's Republican lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, told CNN on Monday."}

Video Speaker Nancy Pelosi was re-elected to lead the House of Representatives as the 117th Congress convened Sunday evening. Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the House speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest majority in almost two decades as Washington prepares for a new Democratic president. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened under the threat of a deadly pandemic and awaited a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of that chamber. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their votes from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. Her victory means that after two years as President Trump's most outspoken antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, she said in a speech after winning the speakership. Now is certainly a time for our nation to heal. Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus. And defeat it, we will."}

Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein, she let him have her number. Weinstein began calling her late at night, or having his assistant call her, asking to meet. She declined, but said that she would do readings during the day for a casting executive. Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. I was, like, Oh, a woman. Great. I feel safe, Evans said. When Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Weinstein told her that she'd be great in Project Runway, — the show, which Weinstein helped produce — but only if she lost weight. At that point, after that, is when he assaulted me, Evans said. He forced me to perform oral sex on him."}

Biden Jr. campaigned in Atlanta on Monday on behalf of the two Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, for Georgia's Senate runoff election on Tuesday. I've said it before, getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced, but we've known it for the last months. This administration has gotten off to a God awful start. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem. I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work. As our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, from the people. That's our history. That's our law. That's our tradition. That's our Constitution. That's our democracy. Politicians cannot assert, take or seize power. Power is given, granted by the American people alone. I know this campaign, this campaign has been exhausting. You put the hard work in over the last few years to get to this moment. It's been intense. It's been non-stop. But I'm asking you to give everything you've got one more day, one more day. And that one more day, this is not hyperbole, you can change America."}

Nicole Craine for The New York Times ATLANTA — As hundreds of millions of dollars have been pumped into Georgia for a runoff election that will determine which party controls the Senate, few groups have been as vigorously pursued as young voters. Voter registration efforts and political campaigns have tried to reach them through TikTok videos, poetry readings and drive-in events with celebrities. College Republicans have had phone-banking competitions, while other volunteer groups have approached young voters on dating apps, such as Tinder. The work has paid off. More than 75,000 new voters registered ahead of the runoffs, more than half of them under the age of 35. Campaigns put an intense focus on 23,000 young people who were not old enough to vote in November but are qualified to do so in the runoffs. Early voting began in mid-December, and so far, more than three million people have cast their ballots — about 75 percent of the early votes cast in November's general election, which set turnout records. Over 360,000 early voters in the runoffs were between the ages of 18 and 29, according to data maintained by GeorgiaVotes.com. The intense interest surrounding the Senate races has reached across party lines."}

The president is fixated on his loss in Georgia, an obsession that can be explained by two powerful and concurrent motivations — one psychological, one impelled by calculation and grounded in political reality, people close to him said. For starters, Mr. Trump simply cannot believe he lost a once-red Southern state — and cannot comprehend that his own unpopularity hastened a political realignment already taking place in the swing state. At the same time, he is very much in touch with the reality that he holds sway over party's right wing, and sees the runoff as a valuable moment of final political leverage as president. Over the past week, he has whipsawed from supporting the Senate candidates, albeit tepidly, to griping about the legality of the runoffs, far more passionately. The president, who will appear with the incumbent Republicans, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, in Dalton, Ga. on Monday, wrote on Twitter late Friday that the runoff was illegal and invalid, but then urged his supporters a day later to get ready to vote on Tuesday."}

Credit... Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock Georgia elections officials have received at least two requests for investigations into whether President Trump violated state laws prohibiting election interference in his phone call Saturday with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. But as of early Monday afternoon, it appeared no such investigation had been opened. On Sunday, The Washington Post, followed by other news outlets, reported that Mr. Trump, in a recorded phone call, had asked Mr. Raffensperger to find him enough votes to overturn the presidential election results in Georgia, and appeared to vaguely threaten Mr. Raffensperger with a criminal offense. A number of lawyers have since said that Mr. Trump may have violated state and federal laws, but said that such charges may prove difficult to pursue. On Sunday evening, the lone Democrat on Georgia's five-member state elections board wrote a letter to Mr. Raffensperger requesting that his office open an investigation to determine whether Mr. Trump had violated state law. Then, on Monday, the state board of elections received a complaint from John F. Banzhaf III, a law professor at George Washington University."}

To take action otherwise — that is, to unconstitutionally insert Congress into the center of the presidential election process — would amount to stealing power from the people and the states, wrote the group, which included Representatives Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Ken Buck of Colorado, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Tom McClintock of California, Chip Roy of Texas and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.
