But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside."}

They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion.

The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly.

Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist.

Mr. Espaillat, 66, who received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week, said he was not experiencing any symptoms and that he was isolating at home. In a statement, he said he understood that it took time for the vaccine to be fully effective and that he had continued to take all necessary precautions. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that people who test positive for the virus should isolate for at least 10 days after their symptoms start. The two vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19. But neither vaccine is perfect, and researchers remain unsure of how well the shots curb the ability of the virus to silently infect people."}

Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result."}

The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition. While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported."}

Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December."}

A Courtyard Marriott is boarded up after closing in Manhattan. Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who have battled with the Trump administration for more federal aid, have expressed optimism that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., together with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance."}

By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon.

One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization."}

A training session for coronavirus testers in West Virginia. Credit... Kristian Thacker for The New York Times Several states in the American South have been the slowest in the country to roll out Covid-19 vaccines. Georgia has faced a raft of logistical and bureaucratic snags. In South Carolina, the governor gave reluctant health care workers until Friday to get their shots or risk losing their priority status. And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments. And we are determined to eliminate the bottlenecks that are slowing this down. West Virginia, by contrast, has fared much better, administering the most vaccines per capita out of any state in the country."}

But Moderna's chief executive, Stephane Bancel, also noted in an interview with CNBC that the vaccine might have to be adjusted in the future to immunize people against new coronavirus variants or strains, much like flu vaccines are regularly revamped.

Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office. The government says the checks will not be counted as taxable income for the 2001 federal tax returns, but residents of some states may have to pay slightly higher state taxes because of the rebates. One of the states -- Iowa -- has already moved to trim the extra taxes. The others affected are Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon."}

It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman.

They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle.

Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker's compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn't fully reimbursed, Reed said.

In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower."}

This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider.

Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Anxious about taking a new vaccine and scarred by a history of being mistreated, many frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes are balking at being inoculated against the coronavirus. But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families. Critics say it is unethical to strong-arm low-paid workers into being vaccinated. This is a population of people who have been historically ignored, abused and mistreated, said Dr. Mike Wasserman, a geriatrician and former president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine."}

The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday."}

It is cumbersome and difficult for providers to quickly enter information about administered doses, said Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Health. Some vaccine providers, particularly hospitals, also held back some of the state's limited supply, to ensure that booster shots would be available, Gov. Brian Kemp and officials from his administration said on Tuesday. They called that misguided. If this issue continues, the state will take possession of those doses and ensure that vaccinations continue, the governor said. If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it. At first, Georgia also found a mismatch of vaccine supply and demand. Vaccines went to rural parts of the state where 60 to 70 percent of nursing home workers did not want them, Mr. Kemp said, leaving those areas flush with doses while demand crushed supply in urban areas.

We were prepared for challenging times in 2021, and it has been just that, he said. The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said. As the year began, over 280 million people in Europe were living under national lockdowns, and several countries are set to add new measures in the hope of reducing new infections and easing the pressure on strained health facilities."}

Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty."}

On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk."}

Over all, though, the variant was more contagious in each age group than previous versions of the virus. The mutant virus will result in more infections in children unless schools shore up their precautions, experts said. The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other European countries put a premium on opening schools in September and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has forced some to close. In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to close.

The boosted figure comes after President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration would increase how much states got by about 16%. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy praised the Biden administration for setting a three-week window instead of a one-week interval that was in effect under the previous White House. More vaccines are desperately needed as the state aims to ramp up administration of the shots, with about 643,000 given so far since mid-December, Murphy said. The larger amount is still well below the 470,000 doses New Jersey officials calculated would be needed to meet demand.

The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market."}

A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31.

Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel the United States and other countries, as it did Britain."}

He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge.

You would rather run a small deficit or a surplus, so you have some room to spend if the economy does go into a recession, which - most economists think it will in the next couple of years because this expansion is getting so old. But instead, Republicans passed a tax cut that adds $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. Now the spending bill treasury just announced it's going to issue almost a trillion dollars of new debt next year. That's an 84 percent increase."}

By: Ella Koeze · Data delayed at least 15 minutes · Source: FactSet Financial markets continued to rally on Friday, fueled by bets that a Democrat-led government in Washington would robust fiscal stimulus and despite fresh evidence that the United States economy is backsliding as the pandemic surges. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, climbing further into record territory and bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7 percent higher, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose slightly. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed with a gain of 2.4 percent, climbing to a level it last hit in 1990. Though Washington continues to focus on the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol building on Wednesday, the investing world is instead focused on the wave of spending that could come as Democrats assume leadership of the White House and both houses of Congress That enthusiasm also helped investors look past the Labor Department's report on December payrolls, which showed that U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, the first drop since last spring. The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was targeting trillions of dollars in spending. We should be investing significant amounts of money right now, to grow the economy, he said."}

The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing."}

Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men."}

If you're anticipating a stimulus payment that hasn't yet landed, continue to monitor your bank accounts — and your snail mail. The I.R.S. was taking immediate steps to get stimulus payments to the correct accounts, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort, the IRS added. Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. The accounts may then be closed or become inactive — but may remain linked to the taxpayer's I.R.S. records. Tax prep companies have said they're working with the I.R.S. to resolve the issue. TurboTax said affected customers can expect to receive direct deposits starting on Friday. You can check the status of your stimulus payment through the I.R.S. 's Get My Payment tool."}

Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn't respond when asked how he'll handle the legislation."}

Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July.

The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement. Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells. The company's statement said the boosters were being offered to participants six to 12 months after their second shot. Volunteers in early trials received different doses of the vaccine, as part of the company's attempts to calibrate the most effective amount of active ingredient to use."}

Just look at us at here tonight: Black and white, Asian and Hispanic, Native and immigrant, young and old, urban and rural, male and female - from yuppie to lunchpail, from sea to shining sea. We're all here tonight in this convention speaking for America. And when we in this hall speak for America, it is America speaking. When we speak of family, the voice is Mario Cuomo's. When we speak of change, the words are Gary Hart's. When we speak of hope, the fire is Jesse Jackson's. When we speak of caring, the spirit is Ted Kennedy's. When we speak of patriotism, the strength is John Glenn's. When we speak of the future, the message is Geraldine Ferraro."}

We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said. Demand for the limited doses has been high and is expected to increase dramatically Feb. 1, when Idaho residents 65 and older will become eligible. It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates. The legislation that created Idaho's voluntary immunization tracking system doesn't allow the state to collect some demographic information, including race or ethnicity and profession."}

Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter."}

But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. The investigation, which aims to gain an understanding into how the virus jumped to humans from animals, is a critical step so that another pandemic can be avoided. But getting answers is likely to be difficult. Here's what to know about the investigation. China set up hurdles and pushed for control. Apparently worried about drawing renewed attention to the country's early mistakes in handling the pandemic, Chinese officials have used a variety of tactics over the past year to hinder the W.H.O. investigation.
