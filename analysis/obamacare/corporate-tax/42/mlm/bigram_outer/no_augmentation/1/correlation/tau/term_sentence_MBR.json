(From left to right) Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Stephen Bannon When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside."}

That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident.

(Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist.

She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources.

Azar II, excoriated China on Thursday for its bullying of international experts and scientists and acknowledged for the first time that a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was correct when she warned in February that the novel coronavirus might cause a severe disruption to American lives. The official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was muzzled for nine months after issuing the Feb. 25 warning, which threw the stock market into a nosedive and infuriated President Trump, who was on his way back from India at the time. But she was merely repeating what she had learned from a White House Task Force meeting days earlier, Mr. Azar recalled. She got a little ahead of the briefing of the president and the official announcement, Mr. Azar said. But she and we were correct. Mr. Azar made his comments to the Heritage Foundation, during an online seminar that was billed as a talk about lessons learned from the pandemic. He spent much of it describing how China rebuffed offers of help from the United States — and thwarted American efforts to learn more about the virus that has now claimed more than 380,000 American lives."}

Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it.

The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R.

Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel the United States and other countries, as it did Britain."}

Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter."}

A Courtyard Marriott is boarded up after closing in Manhattan. Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who have battled with the Trump administration for more federal aid, have expressed optimism that President-elect Joseph R.

Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31.

The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said.

The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice."}

Mr. Espaillat, 66, who received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week, said he was not experiencing any symptoms and that he was isolating at home. In a statement, he said he understood that it took time for the vaccine to be fully effective and that he had continued to take all necessary precautions. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that people who test positive for the virus should isolate for at least 10 days after their symptoms start. The two vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19. But neither vaccine is perfect, and researchers remain unsure of how well the shots curb the ability of the virus to silently infect people."}

California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower."}

Syracuse University student Ghael Fobes, on the other hand, logged on just after midnight and was able to make appointments for his grandparents.

The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday."}

Over all, though, the variant was more contagious in each age group than previous versions of the virus. The mutant virus will result in more infections in children unless schools shore up their precautions, experts said. The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other European countries put a premium on opening schools in September and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has forced some to close. In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to close.

His legislation would require the state to reverse any findings that businesses violated the rules, refund any fines paid, and restore any suspended or revoked permits or licenses once the state of emergency has ended. I think a lot of people feel like this all came at them fast, they don't fully understand it, and even with the best intentions, they may get caught up in this, he said. Some lawmakers on the committee questioned whether businesses were given adequate warnings. But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action.

But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families. Critics say it is unethical to strong-arm low-paid workers into being vaccinated.

Alex Welsh for The New York Times Deaths from all causes rose sharply during the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic took hold in the United States, reaching levels last seen 75 years ago, according to provisional figures released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics. Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men."}

Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends."}

Members of the Legislature are supposed to undergo testing on Mondays and Thursdays. Ralston spokesman Kaleb McMichen said in a statement that the member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session. The statement said he'll be able to return once he complies with the policy. Clark also had his office space in a building adjacent to the Capitol temporarily taken away. Clark, not wearing a face mask, told reporters he is abstaining from twice-a-week testing until it is available to everyone in the state, particularly teachers and first responders. Testing in Georgia is available to anyone who wants it and is widely accessible. You know, sometimes this job isn't all it's cracked up to be, Ralston said after having Clark removed.

Yang Shiyao/Xinhua, via Associated Press China's National Health Commission said on Friday that more than 1,000 people nationwide were being treated for Covid-19, a day after the country reported its first coronavirus death on the mainland since May. The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition. While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported."}

And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments. And we are determined to eliminate the bottlenecks that are slowing this down. West Virginia, by contrast, has fared much better, administering the most vaccines per capita out of any state in the country."}

The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market."}

If you're anticipating a stimulus payment that hasn't yet landed, continue to monitor your bank accounts — and your snail mail. The I.R.S. was taking immediate steps to get stimulus payments to the correct accounts, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort, the IRS added. Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. The accounts may then be closed or become inactive — but may remain linked to the taxpayer's I.R.S. records. Tax prep companies have said they're working with the I.R.S. to resolve the issue.

It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates.

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking in Delaware on Thursday. Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing."}

The department has not asked the correction officers how many of them are willing to take it, Barr said. And without knowing how many vaccines you are going to need, how can they have a plan to distribute it? Correction officers are among the essential workers in the state's 1b group, making them eligible for the vaccine. But the governor's office has said that, because it is receiving only about 46,000 doses a week for those getting a first shot of the two-dose regimen, it is limiting appointments for the time being to people over age 75. Appointments are expected to be expanded in about two weeks to those over 65. Only after those people are vaccinated will appointments be opened to those with preexisting medical conditions and essential workers."}

Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said.

Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face.

Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes.

Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street."}

The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen.

Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells.

But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. The investigation, which aims to gain an understanding into how the virus jumped to humans from animals, is a critical step so that another pandemic can be avoided. But getting answers is likely to be difficult. Here's what to know about the investigation. China set up hurdles and pushed for control. Apparently worried about drawing renewed attention to the country's early mistakes in handling the pandemic, Chinese officials have used a variety of tactics over the past year to hinder the W.H.O. investigation.

He also defended federal guidelines – adopted by his administration – that pushed smokers into the first phase of vaccination, calling it an objective assessment of who is most vulnerable, not a value judgment. Meanwhile, Philadelphia abruptly cut off a vaccine clinic operator amid concerns that it had sought to profiteer from the work. Officials said they ended their relationship Monday with the group Philly Fighting COVID, which had been chosen to run the city's largest vaccination site. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city became concerned when the privacy policy on the group's website changed to allow sharing personal information for people signing up for vaccinations, and the group abruptly stopped its coronavirus testing operations.
